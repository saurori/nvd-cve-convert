# NVD CVE Convert

Utility to convert an NVD CVE JSON 1.1 data feed file into the legacy XML format.
The XML format was [retired in October of 2019](https://nvd.nist.gov/General/News/XML-Vulnerability-Feed-Retirement).

This is not intended to be a 100% accurate backwards compatible conversion, but a "best effort".
Some data in JSON format does not translate back to the XML version.

## Flags

```sh
  -cpe-file string
        path to the NVD CPE JSON Match Feed data file (gzipped). See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds
  -cve-file string
        path to the NVD CVE JSON Feed data file (gzipped). See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds
  -xml-file string
        path to the resulting output XML file
```

## Running

Example run:

```sh
$ go run main.go \
    -cve-file=nvdcve-1.1-modified.json.gz \
    -cpe-file=nvdcpematch-1.0.json.gz \
    -xml-file=nvdcve-1.1-modified.xml
